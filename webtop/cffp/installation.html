    <strong>For full details of how CFFormProtect works, see the project page at

  </p>
  <span style=FONT-WEIGHT:bold>Installation<br>
  </span>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Copy the cfformprotect folder into your web root.
    </li>
    <li>
      Put &lt;cfinclude template="/cfformprotect/cffp.cfm"&gt; somewhere between
      your form tags.
    </li>
    <li>
      On your processing page include the following code:<br>
      &lt;cfset Cffp =
      CreateObject("component","cfformprotect.cffpVerify").init() /&gt;<br>
      &lt;!--- now we can test the form submission ---&gt;<br>
      &lt;cfif Cffp.testSubmission(form)&gt;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;!--- The submission has passed
      the form test.&nbsp; Place processing here ---&gt;<br>
      &lt;cfelse&gt;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;!--- The test failed.&nbsp; Take
      appropriate failure action here. ---&gt;<br>
      &lt;/cfif&gt;
    </li>
    <li>
      Setup your email settings and Akismet in cffp.ini.cfm, if you want to use
      those features (if you leave the email settings blank, you won't receive
      an email when spammer tries to attack your forms)<br>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <strong>Customization</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You can change the values in cffp.ini.cfm if you want to tweak how
      CFFormProtect operates. Descriptions of the values are below.<br>
    </li>
    <li>
      You'll probably want to change what happens when a spam message is found.
      I have it set to display an error, send you an email (if you configured
      this feature) and then cfabort. You can change this at the bottom of
      cffpVerify.cfm. You can use two variables for information on why the
      message was flagged as spam, testsThatFailed and totalPoints. This will
      help you tweak the settings to your liking (to allow more or less messages
      through)
    </li>
    <li>
      If you use the Akismet feature, modify your site's "send email" code that
      sends you good emails, so that it contains the Akismet link to notify
      Akismet of spam that got through their filters. This step is optional but
      very recommended, because Akismet is free, and all they ask is that you
      feed data back into the system when necessary to help them improve it.
      Here is the code I have in my sites for this:<br>
      <pre>&lt;cfif Cffp.getConfig().akismet&gt;<br>	&lt;!--- The following few lines build the URL to allow the user to submit a missed spam notification to Akismet if this is not spam ---&gt;<br>	&lt;cfset missedSpamURL = replace("#Cffp.getConfig().akismetBlo<wbr>gURL##cffpPath#/akismetFailure<wbr>.cfm?type=spam","://","^^",<wbr>"all")&gt;<br>	&lt;cfset missedSpamURL = replace(missedSpamURL,"//","/"<wbr>,"all")&gt;<br>	&lt;cfset missedSpamURL = replace(missedSpamURL,"^^",":/<wbr>/","all")&gt;<br>	&lt;cfset missedSpamURL = missedSpamURL&amp;"&amp;user_ip=<wbr>#urlEncodedFormat(cgi.remote_addr,'utf-8')#"&gt;<br>	&lt;cfset missedSpamURL = missedSpamURL&amp;"&amp;referrer=<wbr>#urlEncodedFormat(cgi.http_referer,'utf-8')#"&gt;<br>	&lt;cfset missedSpamURL = missedSpamURL&amp;"&amp;comment_author<wbr>=#urlEncodedFormat(form[Cffp.getConfig().akismetFormNameField],'utf-8')#"&gt;<br>	&lt;cfif Cffp.getConfig().akismetFormEmailFiel<wbr>d neq ""&gt;<br>		&lt;cfset missedSpamURL = missedSpamURL&amp;"&amp;comment_author<wbr>_email=#urlEncodedFormat(form[Cffp.getConfig().akismetFormEmailFiel<wbr>d],'utf-8')#"&gt;<br>	&lt;/cfif&gt;<br>	&lt;cfif cffpConfig.akismetFormURLField neq ""&gt;<br>		&lt;cfset missedSpamURL = missedSpamURL&amp;"&amp;comment_author<wbr>_url=#urlEncodedFormat(form[cffpConfig.akismetFormURLField],'utf-8')#"&gt;<br>	&lt;/cfif&gt;<br>	&lt;cfset missedSpamURL = missedSpamURL&amp;"&amp;comment<wbr>_content=#urlEncodedFormat<wbr>(form[cffpConfig.akismetFormBodyField],'utf-8')#"&gt;<br>	&lt;p&gt;Akisment thinks this is not spam, if it is please mark this as<br>	missed spam by &lt;cfoutput&gt;&lt;a href="#missedSpamURL#"&gt;clicking here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cfoutput&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;/cfif&gt;<br>   			</pre>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <strong>Tip:</strong> You can enter "viagra-test-123" as your Name when
  testing your form, and Akismet will automatically mark the form submission as
  spam
  <p>
    <strong>INI File settings</strong> (cffp.ini.cfm)<br>
    Most of the values can be left as default, if you want, but you'll need to
    provide values for Akismet if you want to use that test.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>The first section of the ini allows you to set which tests to run. 1 is
    enabled and 0 is disabled </em>:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      mouseMovement
      <ul>
        <li>
          enable/disable the mouse test. This test makes sure the user moved
          thier mouse
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      usedKeyboard
      <ul>
        <li>
          enable/disable the keyboard test. this test makes sure the user used
          their keyboard
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      timedFormSubmission
      <ul>
        <li>
          enable/disable the test to check how long the form entry and
          submission took
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      hiddenFormField
      <ul>
        <li>
          enable/disable hidden form field test. this test makes sure a CSS
          hidden form field is empty
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      akismet
      <ul>
        <li>
          enable/disable the akismet test. uses the public Akismet service to
          test if form contents are spam. This is off by default, because you
          have to provide the details in the second section for Akistmet to
          work.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      tooManyUrls
      <ul>
        <li>
          enable/disable the tooManyUrls test. this test will add up the number
          of URLs that are found in all of the submitted form fields, and 
          mark the submission as spam if the total exceeds the limit configured
          by the tooManyUrlsMaxUrls variable in the ini file.  This test was 
          created by Dave Shuck.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      teststrings
      <ul>
        <li>
          enable/disable the teststrings test. this test will compare the words
          in the form submission to a list of configurable "spammy" words, and 
          mark the submission as spam if one of these words is found.  you can 
          modify the list by editing the spamstrings variable in the ini file.
          This test was created by Mary Jo Sminkey.
